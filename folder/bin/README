# LockLeverPuzzle(plus Escape Room Implementations)

===Overview:===

Folder LockLeverPuzzle has multiple demos of the pieces that would fit together for a specialized puzzle by a class called LockLeverPuzzle. 
This program runs a text-based escape room styled interaction with the user.

The program is run on java through the Main class in LockLeverPuzzle.
Most classes are prompted and work with GenericRoom class.
GenericRoom class will be called directly through the class Maze in the Maze2 package itself.

The classes interact with each other properly and independently for the most part. 

===Permissions=== 
Classes: 
StaticObjects,DynamicObjects,and GenericRoom, Room1Haine, Room2Haine, Room3, Room4
are permitted to be used as long as permission is granted and updates are verified for fair use of personal work.

===Bugs and Future Updates:===

More work will be needed to adjust inventory to carry it through GenericRoom(parent class/superclass) and its subclasses(Room1Haine,Room2Haine,Room3,Room4) and any other rooms in the MazeGame.
LockLeverPuzzle requires review and editing to have it interacting with the user/player.

===File Information=========

To run the game(Main.java file),
$cd LockLeverPuzzle 
$javac *.java 
$java Main

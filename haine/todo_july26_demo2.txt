Currently:
-Can only play one randomnly chosen riddle, with one attempt at answer
	>Once riddle answered without spaces, program ends
-Riddle answers are only one word
-Riddles are not hard
	>Plan to plant clue items in rooms to give hints to riddles

Future:
-Maybe make it so program keeps running if you haven't answered a riddle correctly, until you answer a riddle correctly
-Add riddles that have multi-word answers, and implement way to detect a multi-word answer

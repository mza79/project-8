Folder LockLeverPuzzle has multiple demos of the pieces that would fit together for a specialized puzzle by a class called LockLeverPuzzle.

The classes interact with each other properly and independently for the most part. 
More work will be needed to piece the classes together better and have user/player interaction with it.
Parent Inventory and children StaticObjects and DynamicObjects still require some review and processing with interactions with the user/player itself.

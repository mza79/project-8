# LockLeverPuzzle(plus Escape Room Implementations)

===Overview:===

Folder LockLeverPuzzle has multiple demos of the pieces that would be intended to fit together for a specialized puzzle by a class called LockLeverPuzzle. 
This program runs a text-based escape room styled interaction with the user.

The program is run on java through the main class.
Most classes are prompted and work with the start class.

The classes interact with each other properly and independently for the most part. 
Inventory is passed through all the Rooms(superclass and subclass: GenericRoom, Haine1Room, Haine2Room, Room3, Room4).

===Permissions=== 
Classes: 
StaticObjects,DynamicObjects,and Start 
are permitted to be used as long as permission is granted and updates are verified for fair use of personal work.

===Bugs and Future Updates:===

LockLeverPuzzle requires review and editing to have it interacting with the user/player.

===File Information=========

To run the game(Main.java file),
$cd LockLeverPuzzle 
$javac *.java 
$java Main

# LockLeverPuzzle(plus Escape Room Implementations)

===Overview:===

Folder LockLeverPuzzle has multiple demos of the pieces that would fit together for a specialized puzzle by a class called LockLeverPuzzle. 
This program runs a text-based escape room styled interaction with the user.

The program is run on java through the main class.
Most classes are prompted and work with the start class.

The classes interact with each other properly and independently for the most part. 

===Permissions=== 
Classes: 
StaticObjects,DynamicObjects,and Start 
are permitted to be used as long as permission is granted and updates are verified for fair use of personal work.

===Bugs and Future Updates:===

More work will be needed to adjust inventory to carry it through Room1,Room2 and any other rooms in the MazeGame.(Making a parent class for all rooms)
LockLeverPuzzle requires review and editing to have it interacting with the user/player.

===File Information=========

To run the game(Main.java file),
$cd LockLeverPuzzle 
$javac *.java 
$java Main

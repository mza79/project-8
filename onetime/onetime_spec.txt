CharMan  :   performs the character conversions to bit arrays, xor operations, and random array generation
             manages character input and bitwise operations, will be called by keygen to generate a key of length message.length() 
	     as a demonstration. 
	     
UserInput:   Takes in user input either from the console using Scanner.  Converts the Plain text message into a string to be passed to encrypt object.

FileInput:   Takes in a file, a text file of a plain text message, and converts it into a string, stores the length of the string.  

genKey:      Takes the length of the UserInput Object or from the FileInput Object say string.length()=n and generates n shorts or chars, 
             and stores them into a file or an array of type short, or type char length n.  Also writes the key to file.
	     
Encrypt:     Encrypt object takes a key, and a message, and uses CharMan to encrypt the message bitwise against the key, 
             displays the encrypted message interpreted as shorts or chars, saves the encrypted message to file as a string of chars or as a *.bin file
	     sequence of 2 byte shorts.
	     
Decrypt:     Decrypt object takes a key (from file), and an encrypted bin file, and uses CharMan to decrypt the message bitwise against the key.
             Displays the decrypted message to the terminal, and or saves the decrypted message to file.
	     
Menu:        Menu object, prints a menu and reads in user selections for various options such as input Message from Keyboard, read Mesage from text file, 
             generate a key the same length as the message, encrypt a message, decrypt a message or quit.  While loop with a switch statement.

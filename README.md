# maze 
In the folder maze is a demo of a maze that has a key.  It is currently incomplete.   The player must traverse from room (0,0) to the room 
with the key, collect the key and traverse to the room with the Door, use the key and exit the maze to win.

currently to test the maze classes run the following commands
$ cd maze
$ javac *.java
$ java MazeGame


In the game use the commands Enter to cycle through the rooms in the array list, 

Commands:  help, map, quit, left, right, down, up.

Commands are case insensitive. "Map" displays a static map of the maze. "Quit" exits the main loop and 
terminates the program. The player moves around the map using the commands "Up","Down","Left",Right" where 
motion occurs to the adjacent room provided that there is no obstruction or Wall.  

The program will terminate after 100 rounds of user input.
